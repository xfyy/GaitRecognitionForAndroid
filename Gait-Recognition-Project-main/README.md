# Gait-Recognition-Project
This is a Gait Recognition project for smartphones that I was working on for my undergrad thesis. This system uses kNN algorithm. The code in MainActivity, App, ActivityServiceRecognised, ExampleService and Accuracy all need to run together for the system to work. Depending on the configuration required, only one of the 3 classes, MainActivityT, MainActivity2 or MainActivity3, should be used with the other classes. 

MainActivityT uses a k value that is set to 1.

MainActivity2 uses a k value that is set to 3.

MainActivity3 uses a k value that is set to 5.

Editting the class MainActivity is required for changing the variables of the system or changing the accuracy.

All code was created in Android Studio and was therefore tested and assessed on a smartphone with an Android operating system. A Samsung S9 was used in my testing.
